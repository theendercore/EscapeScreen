# EscapeScreen

Add a Second Escape Key!

Since Minecraft 1.19.3 and above, you can no longer use "virtual" keyboard inputs. This means if you had rebound your
Escape to something like Caps Lock, it would just not work.
So this mod aims to somewhat fix that. What it does it adds a second Escape key that you can rebind to any key you want.
Which is (from what I know) the only way of fixing this aside of overriding a lot of vanilla code.
